title = "Linkerd online community meetup this Wednesday: Linkerd 2.6, distributed tracing, traffic splitting, and more!"

+++
This Wednesday, September 25th, at 9am PT / 4pm UTC, please join Oliver, Thomas, William, and special guests **Tarun Pothulapati** and **Carol Scott** for this month's Linkerd community meeting!

We'll cover:

Linkerd 2.6 checkin: what's the scoop?
Linkerd and distributed tracing demo w/Tarun
Linkerd 2.6 traffic splitting UI preview w/Carol

And of course, plenty of Q&A time!

**Important note:** We're changing things up! No more Meetup.com and Crowdcast. This meeting will use Zoom. We're also going have the meeting at the same time every month, and post the videos to YouTube afterwards. We hope this makes it a bit easier for everyone to attend!
